# topKMining

This is the implementation of the TTFE algorithm. Some related literature articles and algorithms are also included. 

## Literature

The development of top-$k$ mining algorithms of the branch of the TTFE. 

## Datasets

Six famous datasets are included. 

Example datasets used for algorithm debugging, testing, and tracking are proposed. 

A Python script is written for 2D dataset generation. 

## Codes

The following are the codes of the top $k$ mining algorithms. 

## SPMF

A set of algorithms forked from the SPMF platform. 

### THUI

This is an extensive implementation of the original THUI algorithm, abstracted from the SPMF. 

This implementation can output accurate results without an additional pruning strategy or fuzzy results with the additional pruning strategy. 

Multiple layers of loops are set up for better experiment implementation. 

THUI can only focus on the threat values. 

### THUFI

The implementation of mining top-$k$ high threat and frequency itemsets based on the original THUI. 

THUFI will first compute the top-$k$ high threat itemsets and top-$k$ high frequency itemsets respectively. 

Subsequently, the two results will be merged to form the final results. 

This is not an accurate algorithm since it is implemented by directly replacing the utility values with the FU values. 

When comparing the baseline model THUI and TTFE, THUFI should be used since it has two kinds of values. 

### TFUI

The improved implementation of the THUFI algorithm with file configures. 

It supports the alpha and the beta values directly set in the database file. 

### TTFE

The implementation of mining top-$k$ high threat and frequency event sets. 

It supports super-parameters directly set in the database file. 

It uses better data structure and sorting algorithms. 

It has more friendly debugging procedures. 

#### TTFE_v1

This is an accurate algorithm without tree construction procedures. 

It will also compute the top-$k$ event sets in each transaction. 

#### TTFE_v2

This is an accurate algorithm with tree construction procedures. 

It has better performance due to the node pruning. 

#### TTFE_v3

More switches are set. Users can try to run TTFE with different combinations of switches. 

More experimental options and file operations are provided. 

#### TTFE_v4

Extended experiments are merged. 

**Data should be cut according to a fixed ratio if it is hard to test GUMM due to the limitation of computing memory.**
